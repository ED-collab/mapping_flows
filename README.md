# mapping_flows
Mapping flows across a landscape with GIS coordinates in R

These scripts are for generating a map using pre-existing shapefiles and populating it with arrows representing flow between geographic locations. The idea is to present generalizable code for mapping flows (in this case of seeds).

This aims to support visualization of work on seed flow mapping and the movement of both plant germplasm and seed-vectored disease.
